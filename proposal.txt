Webprog Final Project Proposal
=============================
<TODO: Fill in this proposal template and remove the TODOs (including the < >).>

Project Title: <TODO: Come up with a name, or a short description will do>
Your Name: <TODO>

Description
-----------
<TODO: Tell us about your project idea. What will it do, how will it work. A paragraph or two should do. It may be helpful to include a "feature list" that details what users will be able to do in the app.>

Milestone(s)
------------
<TODO: Talk a bit about the process you want to take, and what you'd like to have done by the check-in milestone. I won't hold you to that milestone; we just want you to be thinking about the order you'll be working on things. If there are any current or anticipated blockers (e.g. needing to get data from an external source or getting feedback on something), please identify those here too.>

External libraries and code
---------------------------
<TODO: Identify any external libraries or code you plan to use, and describe how it fits into your project. It's fine to say "None" here, and you can change your mind later.>

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
<TODO: Identify any sources you plan to consult, except for code listed above. This might include getting feedback from users or getting data from an external source.>

Anything else?
-------------
<TODO: Anything else you'd like me to know?>
