Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: Online Arcade
Your Name: Anton Urbanek, 11940992

Overview
--------
So far, I've finished the basic prototype for the Tetris clone. It's actually fully playable, but there are still some missing features. For example, I haven't included any
MongoDB connection, yet. Also, in general, I want to do more styling. For now, the entry page for the games is simply an empty page with a link to the game HTML. Also, I would like
to implement the PacMan clone I mentioned in the proposal. This should be easy enough since I can reuse code from the tetris clone. In this regard, I ought to clean up the code a bit and
split it up into multiple js-files (since I am planning to use some functions across both games).

Project Changes
---------------
No changes planned.

Implementation Details
----------------------
Well, I think I've described the implemented code pretty well in the JavaScript file itself. But for now the codebase is structured as follows: index.html includes links which open
the respective game HTML (for now we only have tetris.html). I am still debating whether each game should have its own CSS. For now, each game also has its own monolithic js-file. I am planning
on splitting up and modularizing those monoliths later.

External libraries and code
---------------------------
Just in case, I'm going to list canvas here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/canvas
Other than canvas, I am not using anything special.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
Here are a few links to resources that helped me implement Tetris:
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-tetris-game-with-html-canvas-css-and-javascript-on-autocode-132c8346e60c
https://medium.com/swlh/building-tetris-in-js-the-rotation-problem-and-asynchronous-functions-3a7c42dcac8d

https://web.itu.edu.tr/~msilgu/tetris/tetris.html

I didn't copy any code directly from those resources, it's more the case that some elements influenced my approach to certain challenges when creating this prototype.

Anything else?
--------------
For the proposal you asked me (in blackboard) whether or not I would write this in pure JavaScript. I wanted to answer your question sooner, but I forgot about it. Anyways, excluding
canvas: Yes, this will be written in pure JavaScript and also HTML and CSS.

Additionally, I'm sorry for the delayed turn-in... I thought the submission deadline for the milestone was the 22nd (I look at the wrong group, sorry).
